# Disbanded Webpage

This is a hobby-website made for/about the World of Warcraft raiding-guild called Disbanded.

It is made by me, ThoernVE who is a player in the guild and also a beginner programmer.

The page contains information about characters, stats from raiding, dungeons and season cutoffs aswell as some news and an about page.

It uses API's from Raider.IO in order to get information regarding characters, raids or progress.

It is currently still only a sideproject and might se continous work in the future. For now it is not being published to a domain, but rather kept on Github Pages.
