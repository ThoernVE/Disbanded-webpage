        <h1>Insane guild Disbanded hella progs the queen superfast</h1>
        <p>
            Wild guild progs the boss hella fast. Pumpers pumped and healers healed.<br> 
            Tanks unkillable AF, needs nerfs? Rumors say race to world first might have a new kid on the block that might do some upsetting results next season.<br>
            Apparently will play 20 shamans for the upcoming mythic prog. Class is hella OP and needs nerfs, probably remove wrists for all shamans.<br>
            Gigachad raidleader Codussy had this to say: "19 scarecrows and one hella lit scaley downs big badonkadonk spider".<br>
            One of the raiders, who wish to be anonymous said: "The badonkadonk scared me a bit. I couldn't even focus on padding."
