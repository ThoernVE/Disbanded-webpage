    <h1>Insane guild Disbanded shocks the world with record-breaking clear</h1>
    <p>
        Wild guild progresses on the boss superfast. Roles were being played incredibly in this astounding victory.<br>
        Tanks were quite unstoppable and umors say that the Race to World First might have a new kid on the block that might do
        some upsetting results next season.<br>
        Apparently will play 20 shamans for the upcoming mythic progression. The class tuning seems too good to pass up and will play without the wrist-slot equipped.<br>
        Raidleader Codaks had this to say: "19 scarecrows and one shining dragon takes down the big Spider-Queen. Seems like an incredible feat of strength to me!".<br>
        One of the raiders, who wish to be anonymous said: "Spiders scare me a bit. I couldn't even focus on
        playing correctly."

    <h1>New website created!</h1>
    <p>
        The Disbanded raiding guild is now having a website created! They have "paid" for the
        Heal/Dps/Tank/webdesigner/programming student/maker of consumables ThoernVe to create a website fit for the guild. Work is in progress and will
        continue until further notice.
